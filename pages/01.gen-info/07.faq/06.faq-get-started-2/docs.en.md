#### NEM Forum

The NEM forum has many issues reported and solved in the [Tech Support](https://forum.nem.io/c/tech-support) Category of our forum. Please search there for the issue you are having, the search bar in the top right of the page is very useful. When getting help with an exchange issue, topics should be posted in [Exchange Support](https://forum.nem.io/t/exchange-support-lost-xem-at-an-exchange-post-here/6550)

#### Common Troubleshooting Tips

##### No balance, Red Node, no dashboard

Most Likely you are not connected to a node, click the red node icon, and select a new node from the dropdown.

#####  Faucet, duplicate cookie found

These issues will be answered by the faucet owner in [this thread](https://forum.nem.io/t/nem-mainnet-faucet-open/3318)
