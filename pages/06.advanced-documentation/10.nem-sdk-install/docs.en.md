# NEM-sdk
NEM Developer Kit for Node.js and the browser

---

This SDK is just a "draft" for now, lot of things will change as development and feedback goes, but it is enough to start developing great applications.

[Nano Wallet](https://github.com/NemProject/NanoWallet) will integrate this library instead of everything being merged in the same project. So we have a real separation between core and client.
