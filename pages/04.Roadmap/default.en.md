title: 'NEM Foundation Roadmap'
---

## What is NEM?
[NEM](https://nem.io/) is designed to be the plug-and-play business blockchain. Its unique smart contract
plugins enable highly secure digital asset creation, advanced accounting systems, and
improved business efficiency.

## What is Symbol? (previously Catapult)
NEM’s upcoming core engine release was code-named Catapult after a successful
Branding Proposal Vote by our Community, we have rebranded to Symbol. It will represent
the industry’s most practical and secure blockchain for any kind of business data. In
addition to massive improvements in speed and scalability, [Symbol](https://nem.io/catapult/) will bring new features
that have never been available on any decentralized system. Features like aggregated
transactions, multi-layer multisignature accounts, and native public and permissioned
interaction will make it easy to implement sophisticated smart contract functionality without
writing code or introducing security flaws.
Symbol is a next-generation, open-source decentralized blockchain platform from NEM that
connects businesses to the blockchain, helping them to reduce cost, complexity, and find
new ways to create value. It has increased speed, usability, security, and flexibility – making
Symbol the smart, pragmatic choice for both enterprise and developers.
This roadmap represents the NEM Foundation’s best information based on our plans to
support NEM with Symbol core. A more in-depth technical review of the core features being
implemented on Symbol can be found on the [Catapult Server Github](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server) and the [NEM
Development Center.](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/account.html)
