When you log in for the first time, your browser downloads a backup of your wallet. More on backups later in this guide.

You are now presented with the dashboard. The dashboard shows some basic information about your account and harvesting income. There is also market information to keep track of the exchange rate.

Open "Account" by clicking on it in the top right corner of the NanoWallet. Account Information shows, for example, your NEM address for receiving funds and also your vested balance for harvesting.

From here you can also create a backup of your wallet.
**We recommend backing up to a file AND to paper!**

### 3.1 Backup to a file
If you didn't store the .wlt file on wallet creation, it can be downloaded later by clicking on "Account" in the top-right corner of the wallet and select "Backup wallet."

Watch a demo guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHa_KSXTsIA).
 
Store your wallet file on different drives, for example, USB thumb drives, USB hard drives, and network storage. We recommend encrypting the file with a tool like TrueCrypt or 7-zip before storing it on a different drive.
 
**Reminder: Without your password your wallet file is useless!**
### 3.2 Backup to  paper
Enter your password on the "Private key" section on the account page and press "+".

You can now either write this information on a paper or take a screenshot to print it out. Store it in a safe place.
