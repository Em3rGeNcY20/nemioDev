title: 'NEM Foundation Roadmap'

#### What is Catapult?
NEM’s upcoming core engine release is named Catapult. It will represent the industry’s most practical and secure blockchain for any kind of business data. In addition to massive improvements in speed and scalability, [Catapult ](https://nem.io/catapult/) will bring new features that have never been available on any decentralized system. Features like aggregated transactions, multi-layer multisignature accounts, and native public and permissioned interaction will make it easy to implement sophisticated smart contract functionality without writing code or introducing security flaws. 

**Catapult is built as an open-source distributed ledger for management and trading assets, including security tokens, retail purchases, financial services, supply chain, voting, notarization, customer records, cryptocurrency, and many more.**

This roadmap represents the NEM Foundation’s best information based on our plans to support NEM with the Catapult core. A more in-depth technical review of the core features being implemented on Catapult can be found on the [Catapult Server Github](https://github.com/nemtech/catapult-server/issues) and the [NEM Development Center](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/account.html).
