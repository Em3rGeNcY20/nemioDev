#### The NEM team will be giving bounties for the following projects. 
#### The projects will all have the following three parts.

1) A working demo written in ES6 Javascript running on nodejs (preferred language)
2) Open-sourced code on Github under an MIT license
3) A detailed “how to” blog explaining exactly how the project was built and walking through others on how to build it.

The following projects are offered as suggestions. We will be willing to add additional projects if a community member suggests them.

Please make project proposals to jabo38 before starting. Suggestions for new ideas are welcome too! Blogs should be written in Markdown (also the language of this forum for posting) and images for blogs hosted in the cloud. Previewing a blog written in Markdown can be done on http://dillinger.io/10.
