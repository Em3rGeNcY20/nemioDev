### 5.1 Multisignature and Multi-User Accounts
The more advanced and most secure way of securing your funds is multi-signature. NEM's current implementation of multisig is "M-of-N", meaning M can be any number equal to or less than N, i.e., 1-of-4, 2-of-3, 4-of-9, 11-of-12 and so on. NEM also allows "N-of-N" accounts, i.e., 1-of-1, 2-of-2, 5-of-5, 10-of-10 and so on.
 
NEM's multisig is supported by all NEM wallets including NCC, Android, iOS, Nano, and NEMpay. Multisig accounts are as easy to set up as a few clicks and even have push notifications sent to your mobile or desktop wallet notifying you to sign.

If you are interested in multi-signature accounts, you can read more about it [here](https://blog.nem.io/how-to-use-multi-signature-accounts/). And you can watch a series of demo videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsF18TXYx_cYrTZJ42t-CuQ/videos?shelf_id=0&sort=dd&view=0).
