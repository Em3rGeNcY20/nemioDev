**How to Audit Files**

Use auditing to check whether a file is different from your notarized version. This lets you know whether a given copy of your notarized file has been modified in any way.

Now that you have your file or/and another file that needs to be audited (checked for authenticity) once again make a visit to the Services tab in your NanoWallet and click on Audit Apostille.

There you will find a box where you can drag and drop any file in the Apostille format. We will be using our "patent" example from the last page.

As you can see the file was successfully audited, and anyone can trust that the contents have not been modified.
