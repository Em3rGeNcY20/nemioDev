You will learn how to activate and start delegated harvesting in NanoWallet. Additionally, you will learn two ways for harvesting.  These are delegated harvesting on a remote server provided by somebody else, or learning how to use delegated harvesting by running a local NIS yourself.

**To activate and start delegated harvesting in NanoWallet you need a [XEM Account](https://blog.nem.io/how-do-i-get-importance-on-the-nem-blockchain/) with at least a 10'000 XEM vested balance.**
To check how long it takes for you to get a vested balance of 10'000 XEM, you can use [this](http://samesake.com/xem/harvesting-calculator/) harvesting calculator.
