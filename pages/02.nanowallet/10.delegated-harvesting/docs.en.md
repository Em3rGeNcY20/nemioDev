You will learn how to activate and start delegated harvesting in NanoWallet. Additionally, you will learn two ways for harvesting.  These are delegated harvesting on a remote server provided by somebody else, or learning how to use delegated harvesting by running a local NIS yourself.

**To activate and start delegated harvesting in NanoWallet you need a [XEM Account](https://blog.nem.io/how-do-i-get-importance-on-the-nem-blockchain/) with at least a 10'000 XEM vested balance.**

"Vested" means the XEM have stayed in your account for a certain number of days. Every day 10% of your UNVESTED coins become vested. This means an account with 20,000 XEM will take about a week to accumulate the 10,000 vested XEM needed for harvesting.
