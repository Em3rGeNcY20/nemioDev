Delegated harvesting has many advantages for users and most importantly, for the NEM ecosystem.

First, it allows NEM to use a tiered architecture. The first tier is supernodes. Supernodes do the heavy lifting of creating blocks and confirming transactions. The next tier is light clients, such as the NanoWallet. NanoWallet users can collect harvesting rewards without downloading the entire blockchain, and continue to collect rewards even while their computer is off.

Another advantage of delegated harvesting is that it enables a high proportion of users to participate in the Proof of Importance (POI) system. The POI system rewards users for keeping a certain amount of currency in their wallet over time, but also for making frequent transactions. Both of these behaviors are good for the ecosystem, and delegated harvesting is the main reason users want to increase their POI scores.
