Thanks to the NEM Voting Module anyone can create and participate in polls using Blockchain technology.

The NEM voting platform is a new NanoWallet module that allows anybody to create and vote on polls stored on the NEM blockchain. The vote counting is made by the client with open source code, so that it is completely transparent. All the information is publicly available to everybody.
NEM is ideal for a voting system due to the importance score inherent to every account on the network, which provides a very interesting way to weight votes.
