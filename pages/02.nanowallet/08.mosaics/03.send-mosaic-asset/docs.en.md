## Transfer of Mosaic
### Introduction
Everything is set up now and you are ready to sell your first field(s) to investors. Since you are using NEM to manage your fields, your investors also need to set up a NEM NanoWallet. Once done, they can send you their account address.

### Transfer (farmers view)
Investor 1 (Alice) has set up the NanoWallet and wants to buy **2 fields** from you. 
The account address from Alice is: TC2S7V-55FISZ-BJJBP4-UZUDTO-X42P7O-H5WJET-NU4A

To send 2 fields to the account, go to Send in NanoWallet and choose "Mosaic transfer":
