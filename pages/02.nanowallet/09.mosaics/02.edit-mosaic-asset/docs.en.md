## Transfer of Mosaic
### Introduction
Everything is set up now and you are ready to sell your first field(s) to investors. Since you are using NEM to manage your fields, your investors also need to set up a NEM NanoWallet. Once done, they can send you their account address.

### Transfer (farmers view)
Investor 1 (Alice) has set up the NanoWallet and wants to buy **2 fields** from you. 
The account address from Alice is: TC2S7V-55FISZ-BJJBP4-UZUDTO-X42P7O-H5WJET-NU4A

To send 2 fields to the account, go to Send in NanoWallet and choose "Mosaic transfer":

Remove the "nem:xem" mosaic:

Choose "farmer.potato:field" from the "Currency" dropdown and click "Attach":

Add the account address from Alice in the "To" field. Set the amount for the field(s) on the right side, enter your wallet-password and click "Send":

Once you have sent the mosaic asset(s), go to the Dashboard and check, if the transfer was successful:

To check all her owned mosaics, the investor can open the Explorer:

## Change of supply
Your business runs great, in fact, you are thinking about adding another 50 potato fields to your farm. 
How to add those new fields to your Mosaic?
Go to Services - "edit mosaic":

- Select mosaic: farmer.potato:field
- Change type: create 
- Change amount: 50

Check the resulting supply for errors and click "send." Done.

## What about the tomatoes?
Since the potato field business is running great, why not do the same to the tomato fields? 
Since you already have your root-namespace you can create a sub-namespace, for example, "farmer.tomato" and create a mosaic for it just like you did for the potato fields (farmer.tomato:field). Customers happy with your potato asset can now trust your tomato asset too, as they could have both only been created by you.
