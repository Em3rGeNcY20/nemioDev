#### 2.1.3 Private key wallet
A private key wallet can only be created if you already have a private key for a previously created NEM address.

You should use this wallet type if you need to import an old account or paperwallet to a new NanoWallet.

**Keep your private key secure. If someone gains access to it, they could gain control of your account.**
