In this guide, we will create a simple wallet. If you want to learn about the different wallet types, it's covered later in this guide.

Enter a wallet name. Example: LonsFirstWallet
Choose a network. Testnet is used for testing only. Otherwise use Mainnet (recommended.) 
Enter a password. Example: correcthorsebatterystaple
