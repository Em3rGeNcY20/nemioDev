#### 2.1.1 Simple wallet
When you create a simple wallet, the NanoWallet will create a *yourwallet.wlt* file which contains your private key. The file is encrypted with your password. If you want to import the wallet to another computer, you need the .wlt file **AND** the password.

Simple wallets are more convenient than other wallet types because it's easy to import a simple wallet to a new computer just by adding the .wlt file to the new installation. Use a simple wallet if you are just getting started or if you want a wallet that's a little easier to transfer to new devices.
