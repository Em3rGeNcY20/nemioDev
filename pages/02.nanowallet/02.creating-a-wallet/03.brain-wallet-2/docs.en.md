#### 2.1.2 Brain wallet
When you create a brain wallet, the NanoWallet will create a private key which is derived directly from your password/passphrase. As the name suggests, a brainwallet is meant to be only secured by a password/passphrase which can be remembered without further backups. You can log into a brain wallet from any NanoWallet on any computer; a .wlt file is **NOT** needed, nor is the private key ever stored in the wallet file as it will be derived each time independently. 

**Because of that reason, we recommend an extra long passphrase, e.g., at least 12 random words.**
