## Red Node
When you log in, check the top right side of the screen to make sure the node indicator is green.

If it is red, you are no longer connected to a blockchain node and you will need to connect to a new one. If this is the case, you may not see your account balance displayed.

Click on the node indicator to bring up the Nodes list window.

Click on the "Select a node" drop-down and pick any node listed. Close the window and wait a few seconds. If the node indicator at the top of the screen turns green, you are now connected and you should see your account balance listed correctly. If not, try again with another node.
