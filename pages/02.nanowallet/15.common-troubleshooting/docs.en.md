## Red Node
When you log in, check to make sure the node indicator is green.

If it is red, you are no longer connected to a blockchain node and you will need to connect to a new one. If this is the case, you may not see your account balance displayed.

Click on the node indicator to bring up the node selection window.

Click on the Nodes list drop-down and pick any node listed. Close the window and wait a few seconds. If the node indicator at the top of the screen turns green, you are now connected and you should see your account balance listed correctly. If not, try another node.
