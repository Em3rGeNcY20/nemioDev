title: 'NEM Foundation Catapult Testnet'
---

NEM Foundation has launched an experimental network to showcase Catapult. 

The testnet is currently configured as a private chain. Public network capabilities will be introduced along with the publication of new development milestones.

Note: The network might be offline, reset, or taken down without previous notice.  We recommend [installing your environment locally](https://github.com/tech-bureau/catapult-service-bootstrap) for learning and development purposes.
